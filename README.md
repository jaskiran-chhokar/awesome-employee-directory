# Awesome Startup Employee Directory 

For this project, I built an app for a fictional company called "Awesome Startup" - a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. 

They need a smart way for employees to share their contact information with each other. 

## Random User Generator API 

I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to fetch a list of 12 random employees, and used that data to build a prototype for an employee directory.
