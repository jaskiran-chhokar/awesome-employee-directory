# Awesome Startup Employee Directory 

For this project, I built an app for a fictional company called "Awesome Startup" - a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share their contact information with each other. 

**Live Version:** https://jaskiran-chhokar.github.io/awesome-employee-directory/

## Project Requirements

### :information_desk_person: Random User Generator API
    
:heavy_check_mark: Use the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to fetch a list of 12 random employees.

:heavy_check_mark: Utilize data provided by the API to build a prototype for an employee directory.

:heavy_check_mark: Request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

:heavy_check_mark: Use JavaScript programming to asynchronously handle required data. 

:heavy_check_mark: Modal window must contain a function close button. That way, the user can easily exit out. 

:heavy_check_mark: Modal window should consist of two "prev" and "next" buttons, in order to allow the user to easily switch back and forth between employees. 

### :mag_right: Search/Filtering Component

:heavy_check_mark: Allow the user to search for a specific employee with a search bar that filters for employees by name.
